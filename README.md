# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

The goal of this analysis is to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. The PyBer Company operates in three types of cities: urban, suburban, and rural. In a previous analysis, we calculated the ride count for each type of city,the average fare per ride, and average number of drivers. We also compared each city's metrics and the average ride fare to the total number of rides per city. In this analysis, a deep dive was taken to create a summary data frame that organized total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver and the multiple line plot.

### Results

From the summary data frame above, it can be seen that there is a direct correlation between how populated a city is and the total number of rides being taken according to the city type. This also directly affects the total number of drivers and the total fares registered by city type. Although the total number of rides, drivers and fares decrease as the cities become farther from urban areas, the average fare per ride and per driver seems to increase. This relation can be explained as there is more accessibility of the PyBer service in urban and surburban areas than rural areas. Less drivers in rural areas may lead to a more average fare per ride due to less drivers in the area.

With the multiple-line chart above, it is visible to compare total fares by city type over a period of months, specifically five. The number of rides appear to peak at the end of February and fluctuates throughout the month of March. This applies to all the city types throughout these months, except for the line in suburban cities, where there is a sharper increase during the month of April.

## Summary

Some recommendations that the PyBer Company can take from this analysis are:
* Since the total fare by city type seems to increase during the month of April in suburban cities, PyBer should research to what causes the surge during that month and apply that to the other types of cities so as to increase revenue and profit.

* There are increases in the total fare per ride where there are less drivers. With this information, PyBer can change ride-share prices by limiting or increasing the number of drivers they have during a certain time to achieve its annual profit goal.

* The average fare per ride shows a gradual increase from more populated cites to less populated cities. However, the average fare per drive increases drastically when following the same trend. It basically costs a user more money to use the service in less populated areas. PyBer may want to hire more  more drivers in the rural areas in order to increase their revenue and profits to match the other city types.
